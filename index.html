    <p style="font-style:italic;" style="width: 100; " style="font-size:50%;"> Although humans have always been interested in the natural history of the animals they saw around them, <br> and made use of this knowledge to domesticate certain species, <br> the formal study of zoology can be said to have originated with Aristotle.
        He viewed animals as living organisms,<br> studied their structure and development, and considered their adaptations to their surroundings and the function of their parts. <br> The Greek physician Galen studied human anatomy and was one of the
        greatest surgeons of the ancient world, <br> but after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the onset of the Early Middle Ages,<br> the Greek tradition of medicine and scientific study went into decline in Western Europe,<br> although it continued
        in the medieval Islamic world.
